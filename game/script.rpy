    Welcome to our disgustingly ordinary town...{w=0.66}
    In a monotous world, where there is only a single God,{w=0.33}
    that everyone for some reasons accepts.

    Of course if there is only one God,{w=0.33}
    then so is the Church behind him.{w=0.66}
    The most powerful organization worldwide.

    Never been so fed up before,{w=0.33}
    I started thinking,{w=0.33}
    what could make my everyday life a bit more colorful in a way.

    Outwardly I am an absolutely normal person.{w=0.66}
    I don't want to receive extra attention,{w=0.33}
    even though I am capable of that.{w=0.66}

    There is no need in it.
